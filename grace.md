[T&L Loot Distribution System](https://www.playthroneandliberty.com/en-gb/news/articles/loot-distribution-rules#:~:text=If%20the%20player%20is%20in,excluded%20from%20the%20drop%20pool)



## Our goal:
Foster an environment where everyone can benefit from our collective efforts.



## Currently, the Silver Eclipse loot (grace) system works as follows:
[Discord Post](https://discord.com/channels/1292390880602492968/1305999717863391242/1305999717863391242)
TL;DR Version below:
1. All players join the guild with 0 grace
2. Players acquire grace by signing up & participating in scheduled content
    - Grace eligible events will be listed in Discord
        - Players must sign up for the event to receive grace
            - Players must attend the event after signing up to receive grace  
        - Each player is responsible for completing their grace-related actions
        - Guild leads will assist with missing grace as a courtesy
        - Each player can review their grace (and everyone elses) using the associated document
3. Players acquire grace by donating epic (purple) items to the guild
    - If the player instead chooses to donate the item to the guild, they will receive 1 grace
    - Players choosing to donate Weekly Boss items will receive 3 grace
4. Players can utilize their grace on donated items
    - If multiple players want an item, the player with more grace can use their amount to receive it first



## Current Problems
1. A player does not need to donate an item that they are not using for their main spec(s)
2. A player does not need to donate an arch boss weapon
3. Players can circumvent or completely attempt to go around our system
    - Instance: In the past few weeks, players have chose to sell/keep an item for personal gain instead of helping the guild
        - In both of the recent instances, it was a conflict weapon (a collective effort)
        - In one of those instances the player attempted to exploit a loophole allowing them to greed during claim period as well as using their grace towards an item they want. We began reviewing the system due to this behavior.
4. __The system is built on trust and the belief that we are all working together__. 
    - This concept is inherintly exploitable
    - By players completing selfish actions and trying to circumvent the system, they will be driving away members who are participating in the system



## Proposed Solutions
1. Loot will be set so that all items are now being sent to guild storage.
2. World Bosses
    - The user that receives a PEACE drop may request their item for whatever reason they want it for
        - No grace is used
        - The player may request their item using the standard channel
        - No protests may be made from other players
    - CONFLICT boss drops will be processed through the guild's grace system as they represent our collective effort.
3. Arch Bosses
    - All items will be processed through our Grace system to ensure that players do not greed items that represent our collective effort.
    - When a player is awarded an Arch Boss item that was processed through the grace system
        - They must immediately upgrade it to +1
            - This process binds the item to the player.
            - The item must then be linked into the guild chat. This acts as a display-of-good-faith.
4. Internal Guild Item Gifting
    - If an item you have won (via grace usage or peaceful boss assignment) is in the guild chest, and you wish to send it to another player instead:
        - The receiving player must have at least 10 or more grace
        - The receiving player will lose 10 of their grace
5. Roster-type Changes
    - Players must now sign-up and state their preferred build(s)
    - Rolling for gear will be hierarchyed as follows: Main Spec -> Off Spec -> Greed
