that let us vote on bosses and sign up for the event simultaneously while creating a Discord event would be awesome. 
Additional features would be allowing me to confirm that those who signed up actually did automatically giving them a grace point. 
I would like to be able to manually add grace points as well as any advisor having the same access. 
There should be capes for it to store an archive or log or something timestamping the date and time the grace was given or ask 
when the grace was earned. A list for everyone to see their grace compared to others as well as a command that allows 
someone to see their own grace. Finally I would like the bot to keep a full guild roster as well as the ability to assign roles so that 
if we make a sister guild I can disseminate whoâ€™s in what guild. Their gear score, equipment Bow/staff, GS Dagger etc.. 
their play preference so PVP, PvE or Both This seems like a lot and I have no idea how hard or easy it would be to do all of 
this so I will compensate you in your payment of preference as long as you tell me what you think it will cost. 

Plan is for a bot that allows:

Feature 1 - Player Related
-Players can sign up
-Players can identify themselves as a DPS / Healer / Tank.
-Players will specify a weapon choice:
---> Any combo of: Greatsword, Sword, Daggers, Longbow, Crossbows, Staff, Wand & Spear
-Players can share their current gearscore
-A combination of weapons and gearscore can be shown to other players. We will utilize this in other features

Feature 2 - Calendar Related
-Leads can create an event for the Discord
--->Events can have additional voting options related to them
-Players can sign up for the events
--->Below each archetype (Healer/Tank/DPS): signed up Players name, weapon specifications, & gear score
--->Players must vote on event at signup as part of process including (DPS/Heal/Tank & RSVP-related)

Feature 2 specification -- Boss Related
-Leads can create a discord calendar event (for upcoming bosses).
-Players to request which boss they want to defeat for loot
--->Choies of: Adentus, Ahzreil, Aridus, Chernobog, Cornelius, Excavator-9, Grand Aelon, Junobote, Kowazan, Malakar, Minezerok, Morokai, Nirma, & Talus
--->Gear specific reasoning doesnt seem necessary

Feature 3 - Grace System
-Must be able to read a google doc for initial setup of our point system
-Must have an action receipt history available to all Players
-Players can be assigned Grace (a point) whenever they are confirmed for an event they previously signed up for
-Players can be assigned Grade for approved actions (donating an item for instance)
--->Players can submit a Grace request.
